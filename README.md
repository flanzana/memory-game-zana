## Introduction
Classic Memory game has been made as a project for Udacity nanodegree Front-End Web Developer.

## Instructions how to play a game
- Open the file [index.html](index.html) in your browser (Google Chrome is recommended) and start the game.
- Try to find all 8 pairs of cards by flipping cards one by one.
- Time starts to run when the first card is flipped.
- When a pair matches, it will stay open, otherwise both cards will close.
- More moves you do, fewer stars you get.
- When all cards are matched, a message with your result will display.
- You can restart a game anytime by pressing the restart button.

## How I built a game
The starter code for all Udacity students had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
